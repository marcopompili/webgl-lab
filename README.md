Personal experiments on WebGL

Some experiments about WebGL, mostly from the book: [WebGL Programming Guide](https://sites.google.com/site/webglbook/home).

It is a very good reading if you want to get into WebGL, mostly the
HTML files in the basics folder are examples from that book.

Some of the early examples are done in CoffeeScript, some of the
later examples (inside the ecma folder) are in JavaScript.

The lib folder contains a JavaScript library used in the examples,
although in the CoffeeScript files I do not use the basic functions
of the library in the more complex examples I do use the library to
focus more on the techniques.

## Notes

The files are still a little messed up but are somewhat useful to
someone that wish to try some basic things with WebGL.
